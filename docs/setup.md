## Pre-Flight Preparation   

**Drone preparation**   

* Please check the number the drones      
* Please check the airframe of the drones, especially for the propeller guard, propeller and the motor  


**Battery preparation**   

* Please prepare a sufficient number of batteries（more than the number of drones）  
* Please charge the battery fully（according to the flight time, the voltage is at less 8.2V)     
* Please check if the battery is inflate, scratched, or leaked. Please do not use these batteries if have these issues  

* **Here are some tips for using batteries at low temperatures**   
    1. Make sure the battery is fully charged before the flight.  
    2. Fully preheat the battery to over 20 degrees.        
    3. Battery preheaters are recommended.   
**Note**: Cold temperatures can affect flight life of the drones.   

More details please jump to [Battery](https://docs.vimdrones.com/setup/#battery)


**Flight path preparation**  

* **Export [Vimdrones GCS] flight project**   
  Use Vimdrones Designer to design the Flight Trajectory, save the .blend file and export the [Vimdrones GCS] flight data


* **Usage Warming**   

    **Do not let the drone collide when design the flight path**  
    It is recommended that the distance between drones is above 2m. If the distance is larger, the formation looks more stable. If the distance is close, the airflow generated by the drone will affect each other.      

    **Do not let the drone exceed the speed limit when design the flight path**  
    1. Max Horizontal Velocity (Up To) is 4m/s  
    2. Maximum Descent Speed (Up To) is 3m/s  
    3. Maximum Ascent Speed (Up To) is 5m/s   
    4. It is recommended that the flying speed of the drone is below 5m/s  
    5. It is recommended that the takeoff/landing speed of the drone is below 2m/s   

    **Do not fly obliquely to land when the drones landing to the ground**  
    Please keep descending vertically.

    **Do not let the drone beyond the fence when design the flight path**   
    1. Height: 120m  
    2. Radius: 500m  

    **Pay attention**  
    When the drone takes off at an altitude of about 10 meters, it will start to execute the flight path and quickly fill in the altitude. It is recommended to vertical take off as a whole, or vertical take off in a row. Of course, it’s not a problem to turn into graphics after takeoff, as long as it doesn’t reach the restricted speed and distance after 10 meters high.


**Warming**    
It's not recommended to fly drones in rain, mist, high humidity, or over water bodies with strong winds. Mazzy Star Drone has venting holes that can expose the electronics inside to moisture. Once water gets inside, short circuits can occur and possibly damage the drone.




## Pre-Flight Setup Procedure

**Drone Light Show System Communication**  

1. Place the tripod，setup the RTK Base and the antennas, use the feeders to connect the RTK Base from the radio antenna and GNSS antenna  
2. Use a network cable to connect the yellow area of the router to the LAN port of the PoE power supply
3. Use another network cable to connect the PoE splitter to the PoE port of the PoE power supply
4. Power on the router
5. Power the RTK Base through the PoE splitter connection 
6. Place the Remote Controller (as the Backup System)

**Pay attention**   

* Please first power the wifi router, then turn on the RTK Base. It will make sure the GCS works properly on the computer. 
* The RTK base station cannot be moved after survey in success, otherwise you need to survey in again.

**Drone Light Show System Layout**  

* According the design to place and locate drones
* Insert the batteries to the drones, but not power the drones   

**Usage Warning**  

* Do not have the show near people too close or hovering above the heads of persons  
* Should have the show in an open space without high obstacles   
* Should make sure of good order inside the venue without any interference or disruption when having the show

When change in Z Axis Rotate in Vimdrones Designer(Real world layout)
![Drone Light Show System](/static/drone-layout-angle.jpg "Drone Light Show System")

![Drone Light Show System](/static/Z-Axis-Rotate_-40.jpg "Drone Light Show System")

*  In default, the orientation of the formation is North. The GCS couldn't change the orientation of the drone formation. The drone will totally fly according to the designed path. If you want to change the orientation. It needs to be set in the designer software before you export the data.   
*  Vehicle -> Export Setting -> Z Axis Rotate(degree in clockwise).    
*  Z Axis Rotate: rotate degree in clockwise to coordinate, default is 0, if your flight field direction is different from your design, this would help.    
*  **Pay attention**: if you change the Z Axis Rotate, the drone' head need to change the same degree.
