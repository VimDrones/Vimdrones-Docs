**Other Additional Equipment**    

* May need 220V power supply from mobile power bank  
* Some of the Power Strips  
* A set of foldable desk and chair (would be very good) 


## Pre-Flight Preparation
* Battery preparation
    * Please prepare a sufficient number of batteries（more than the number of drones）
    * Please charge the battery fully（according to the flight time, the voltage is at less 8.2V)
* Drone preparation
    * Please check the number the drones 
    * Please check the airframe of the drones, especially for the propeller guard, propeller and the motor
* Flight Path preparation
    * Use Vimdrones Designer to design the Flight path, save the .blend file and export the data
    * **Usage Warming:**   
    Do not let the drone collide when design the Flight path. The distance between drones should need more than 2m  
    Do not let the drone exceed the speed limit when design the Flight path. Max Vertical Velocity (Up To) is 3m/s, Max Horizontal Velocity (Up To) is 4m/s. It is recommended that the flying speed of the drone is below 2m/s.    
    Do not let the drone beyond the fence when design the Flight path   

## Pre-Flight Setup Procedure

**Drone Light Show System Communication:**  

* Power the wifi router, connect the wifi router and PoE power supply with a network cable 
* Place the tripod，setup the RTK Base and the antenna, use the Feeder to connect the RTK Base and the antenna
* Connect the RTK Base to PoE power supply with a network cable  (so the wifi router can communicate with the RTK base)
* Power the RTK Base through the PoE power supply
* Power the radio transmitter

**Drone Light Show System Layout:**  

* Place and locate drones, the distance between each drone no less than 2 m
* Insert the batteries to the drones, but not power the drones   

**Usage Warning:**  

* Do not have the show near people too close or over people’ head   
* Should have the show in an open space without high obstacles   
* Should make sure of good order inside the venue without any interference or disruption when having the show

**More details:**

* [DXe Transmitter Manual – Multilingual](https://www.spektrumrc.com/ProdInfo/Files/SPM1000-manual-MULTI.pdf)  

**Usage Warning:**  

* Do not arm the drone near people too close   
* Do not arm the drone over people’ head  


## Battery

* Its capacity is 3000 mAh and the rated voltage is 8.7V. 

**Battery Charging and Discharging**

* At normal charging mode, in constant current stage, the battery is charged in 0.2C until voltage reaches 8.7V, when constant voltage stage starts. Whole charging ends after 3.5 hours or when charging current is less than 60mA(0.02C). 
* At fast charging mode, the charging current is 1C until voltage reaches at 8.7V. The whole process is up to 3 hours or ends when charging current is less than 60mA(0.02C)
	
			
**Usage Warning**

* Do not disassemble, crush and incinerate, drop or leave high pressure on the battery. 
* Do not short circuit the battery 
* Do not expose the battery to temperatures above 45 degrees or below 0 degrees

**Storage Instruction**

* Keep the environment dry and clean 
* Ensure the battery at a storage voltage (7.08-7.62V) if not in use for a long time. If voltage is above or below that level, please charge or discharge battery
* Battery must be fully charged and discharged routinely every three month. After battery is fully discharged, recharge the battery to 50% capacity
